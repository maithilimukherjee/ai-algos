# AI Algos — Semester 5 

A curated collection of implementations, notebooks, assignments and experiments for AI algorithms covered in Semester 5. This repository collects algorithmic implementations, visualizations and practice problems to help learn and teach core AI techniques (search, optimization, probabilistic models, ML algorithms and more).

Goals
- Provide clear, well-documented implementations of algorithms taught in the course.
- Offer reproducible examples and datasets (or links) for exercises and assignments.
- Be a learning resource and a starter codebase for student projects.

Languages & tools
- Primary: Python (>=3.8 recommended)
- Jupyter / JupyterLab for notebooks
- Typical libraries: numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, networkx, tqdm, jupyter, torch / tensorflow (only if deep learning content)
- Linting/formatting: black, flake8 (optional)
